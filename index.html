        <h2>"8 Letters" by Why Don't We<br/>Song Lyrics</h2>
        <br/>
    <ul> 
    <li>You know me the best</li>
    <li>You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge</li>
    <li>That right there is the scariest feeling</li> 
    <li>Opening and closing up again</li>
    <li>I've been hurt, so I don't trust</li>
    <li>Now here we are, staring at the ceiling</li>
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>I've said those words before, but it was a lie</li>
    <li>And you deserve to hear them a thousand times</li>
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say?</li> 
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why am I in my own way?</li>
    <li>Why do I pull you close?</li> 
    <li>And then ask you for space</li>
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say?</li> 
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?</li>
    <li>When your hand's in mine</li> 
    <li>It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?</li>
    <li>I should speak my mind</li> 
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>I've said those words before, but it was a lie</li>
    <li>And you deserve to hear them a thousand times</li>
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say?</li> 
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why am I in my own way?</li>
    <li>Why do I pull you close?</li> 
    <li>And then ask you for space</li>
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh yeah)</li> 
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <li>It's you there in my mind</li>
    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say?</li> 
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why am I in my own way?</li>
    <li>Why do I pull you close?</li> 
    <li>And then ask you for space</li>
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>Why is it so hard to say?</li> 
    <br/><br/><br/>

    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <li>It's you there in my mind (it's only you)</li>
    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <li>It's you there in my mind (you)</li>
    <li>When I close my eyes</li>
    <li>If all it is is eight letters</li>
